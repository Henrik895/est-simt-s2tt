# Prepare Estonian-English and Estonian-Russian datasets for fine-tuning

`run_prepare_dataset.sh` transforms the Estonian-English and Estonian-Russian datasets into Seamless fine-tuning compatible format. This script also includes some filtering and creates partial sequences out of the initial sequences.

These scripts are used together with audio data from https://cs.taltech.ee/staff/tanel.alumae/data/est-pub-asr-data/ and translations from https://cs.taltech.ee/staff/tanel.alumae/data/train-et2en-et2ru.zip.
